# Introduction to Relational Joins 
By: Alan Wang and Dominnic Chant

This repository contains our final project for MSDS 610: Communications for Analytics.

## Introduction
In the world of data science, people use SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with relational databases. Oftentimes, you need to access data across multiple tables. Imagine if you could only work with one table at a time, doing analysis or modeling would be extremely restricted and painful. Fortunately, this isnâ€™t anything we have to worry about. The `JOIN` clause allows us to combine the columns from two or more tables based on shared column values. Once you learn the `JOIN` statement, you can start linking data together, which expands the possibility of how you can explore data. We are going to introduce five different `JOIN`s here. They are `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN` and `CROSS JOIN`. 

## Inner Join

### Concept
`INNER JOIN` returns records that have a match in both tables based on the join condition.

### Example
Create two tables `student` and `score`.
```
-- Create Tables
CREATE TABLE student(
	name VARCHAR,
	class VARCHAR);

CREATE TABLE score(
	student_id INTEGER,
	score INTEGER);
```

`student` has all the students' information. 
```
-- Insert Data
INSERT INTO student VALUES	
	('Bob', 'class 1'), 
	('Alice', 'class 1'), 
	('Evi', 'class 2'),
	('John', 'class 3');

-- Check Table
SELECT * 
FROM student;
```

name | class
------------- | ------------- 
Bob | class 1
Alice | class 1
Evi | class 2
John | class 3

`score` has all the students' test scores.
```
-- Insert Data
INSERT INTO score VALUES	
	('Bob', 92), 
	('Alice', 88),
	('Evi', 95),
	('Peter', 68);

-- Check Table
SELECT * 
FROM score;
```

 student_name | score
------------ | -------------
Bob | 92
Alice | 88
Evi | 95
Peter | 68

`student` and `score` will be used for `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` and `FULL JOIN` as well.

```
-- Inner Join
SELECT *
FROM student
INNER JOIN score
ON student.name = score.student_name; -- this is the join condition
```

`INNER JOIN` returns records that are in both tables you join with. Notice that `John` is not in `score` and `Peter` is not in `student`. Therefore, those records would be ignored and the query returns the following results:

name | class | student_name | score
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Alice | class 1 | Alice | 88
Bob | class 1 | Bob | 92
Evi | class 2 | Evi | 95

## Left Join

### Concept

`LEFT JOIN` will return all records from the left table (i.e. the table you list first in the `JOIN`) and only matching records from the right (i.e. second) table.

### Example
```
-- Left Join
SELECT *
FROM student -- this is the "left" table
LEFT JOIN score -- this is the "right" table
ON student.name = score.student_name;
```

The query would keep all the records from `student` and find matches in `score`. Notice that `John` is not in `score`, the query would not find a match for that record and would leave `NULL` there.

name | class | student_name | score
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Alice | class 1 | Alice | 88
Bob | class 1 | Bob | 92
Evi | class 2 | Evi | 95
John | class 2 | NULL | NULL

## Right Join

### Concept

`RIGHT JOIN` is very similar to `LEFT JOIN`, but does the inverse. It will return all records from the right (second) table and only those that have a match from the left (first) table.

### Example
```
-- Right Join
SELECT *
FROM student -- this is the "left" table
RIGHT JOIN score -- this is the "right" table
ON student.name = score.student_name;
```

`score` is the right table. The query would keep all records from `score` and find matches from `student`. Notice that `Peter` is not in `student`. Therefore, the query would not find a match for `Peter` and would have `NULL` in that row. 

name | class | student_name | score
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Alice | class 1 | Alice | 88
Bob | class 1 | Bob | 92
Evi | class 2 | Evi | 95
NULL | NULL | Peter | 68

## FULL Join

### Concept

`FULL JOIN` is essentially the combination of a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN`. The result set will include all rows from both tables, populating the columns with table values when possible or with `NULL`s when there is no match in the counterpart table. 

<img src=figures/full_join.png width=300>

### Example
```
-- Full Join
SELECT *
FROM student
FULL JOIN score
ON student.name = score.student_name;
```

This is the query results:

name | class | student_name | score
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Alice | class 1 | Alice | 88
Bob | class 1 | Bob | 92
Evi | class 2 | Evi | 95
John | class 2 | NULL | NULL
NULL | NULL | Peter | 68

## Cross Join

### Concept

`Cross JOIN` etrieves the Cartesian product of both tables. Basically, this gives you the combination of all records from both tables. Since it returns all combination, `Cross JOIN` doesn't require any join condition.

### Example

Since `Cross JOIN` is a little different from other `JOIN`s, we are going to use different example to illustrate it. Imagine you walk in a restaurant that you need to pick a `food` option and a `drink` option to make a meal.

```
-- Create Tables
CREATE TABLE food(
	food VARCHAR);

CREATE TABLE drink(
	drink VARCHAR);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO food VALUES
('Cheeseburger'),
('Fried Rice'),
('Fish Taco');

INSERT INTO drink VALUES
('Coke'),
('Sprite'),
('La Croix'),
('Iced Tea');
```

This is their `food` menu:

```
SELECT * 
FROM food;
```

food |
------------- |
Cheeseburger |
Fried Rice |
Fish Taco |

This is their `drink` menu:
```
SELECT * 
FROM drink;
```

food |
------------- |
Coke |
Sprite |
La Croix |
Iced Tea |

You want to see what are all the combination of `food` and `dring` we can have to make a meal. That's when you can use `CROSS JOIN`
