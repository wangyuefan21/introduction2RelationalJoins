# Introduction to Relational Joins 

Imagine if you could only work with one relational database table at a time. Fortunately, this isnâ€™t anything we have to worry about. The `/JOIN` clause allows us to combine the columns from two or more tables based on shared column values. Once you learn the `/JOIN` statement, you can start linking data together. We are going to introduce 5 different `/JOIN`s here. They are `/INNER JOIN`, `/LEFT JOIN`, `/RIGHT JOIN`, `/FULL JOIN` and `/CROSS JOIN`.
